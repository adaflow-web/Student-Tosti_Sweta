//JavaScript is a prototype based language rather than an object-oriented language. If there is one major difference between Python and JavaScript, this would be it.

//Adding a method to an object

/*We've seen what a JavaScript object is. What we haven't seen yet is that you can also add functions to an object. A function attached to an object is called a method just like functions attached to classes in Python. */

// var person = {
//     name : "Bob",
//     age : 19,
//     sayHi : function(){
//         console.log("Hello! I'm Bob.");
//         //we didn't name the function we stored in sayHi and just used function() {...}. This is another use case for anonymous functions.
//     }
// }

// person.sayHi();

// var person = {
//     name : "Bob",
//     age : 19,
//     sayHi : function(){
//         console.log("Hello! I'm " + this.name);
    
//     }
// }

// person.sayHi();
//This is what the keyword this is used for: for an object to refer to itself. The famous self that we used in Python-----(this, think as the object itself. )


// var person = {
//     name : "Bob",
//     age : 19,
//     sayHi : function(){
//         console.log("Hello! I'm " + this.name);
    
//     },
//     callMe : function(){
//         console.log(this);

//     }
// }
// person.sayHi();
// person.callMe();

//executing the callMe method will print this and this is the whole object itself.

//Make one, make two, make many
/*Imagine you are building a game. In your game, you have enemies. They have some properties such as health points and strength. They also have methods, like threaten which enemies use to taunt you and call for help which they use to call more bad guys to help them. Using JavaScript, you could model these using an object*/

//Represent an enemy

/* To avid dupilcation JavaScript have constructor functions. It is a special kind of function made to build new objects from a template.*/

function Enemy(healthPoints, strength){

var meena = new Enemy(150, 15);
var leena = new Enemy(180, 10);
var keena = new Enemy(100, 20);


// meena.callforHelp();
//Enemy is a special kind of function called a constructor function. we create a new Enemy object by calling the constructor function preceded by the new keyword. This is how we call a constructor function. We assign the resulting object to the meena variable and create two more enemies a. Note that the Enemy code has been written only once.

// console.log("Leena has " + (leena.healthPoints).toString() + " healthpoints.");
// keena.threaten();
// console.log(meena);



//object created using a constructor function behaves like any other object

// console.log(keena.healthPoints);

// keena.healthPoints = 110 ;
// console.log(keena.healthPoints);
